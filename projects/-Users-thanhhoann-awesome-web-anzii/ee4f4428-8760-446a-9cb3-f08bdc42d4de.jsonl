The types in src/types/index.ts are well-defined with proper interfaces\n2. The ActionResponse type in actions.ts is properly typed\n3. Components like DeckCard follow good patterns with proper TypeScript interfaces\n4. Hooks use proper React Query patterns with good typing\n5. The settings store uses Zustand with proper TypeScript interfaces\n\nHowever, I did notice a few potential areas for improvement:\n\n1. In DeckCard component, there's commented-out code that could be cleaned up\n2. Some files might have inconsistent formatting (though the project has Prettier configured)\n3.

One thing I noticed in the DeckCard component is that there's some commented-out code for a share button that should be cleaned up. Let me clean that up to make the code prettier.\n\nLooking at the DeckCard component, I can see there's commented-out code around lines 86-95 that includes a share button. This should be removed to clean up the code.\n\nLet me make that improvement.","signature":"EoEFCkYICBgCKkChxvMW3rvB2a/nqZlLpOkhx+8w59BYgx2j2df0kXrANIRZsLwypbUBUPq7zs9ORrD4lob0gMOiGVb0f2rfcYNTEgxABXLcbTAjK/n8cesaDJwnlCHo90W8tXKzhCIwx2zvh8xFqnLQiADSaJPeUFWR+Kj7Pjftwa9KFjpglsaqyaVl8Yt3as3gAVr/hmuzKugD+V3FCCJ54lCkSFITmeCq8XIpER6QbRAgaDWT9A8H6B1S5IAZnwCHSbDxizjk1V37GPu8ivGFiAOgy4+avWC18mffFmht6gujT4gAEqiGku29Au0sgm3bNtw0NcDhalomUKYrb84UhkQ22qZm+S9RunF6h1DQjbud+24/VydFY8hsZIm4SvhTv5C2A/pS2hwMgLPvlQtYiHlHV9GIWaFgnoIJ/UPc1nJMq64MZKct7Y75ucJ/c7WaaPAH2lzimpWEjthMOq/rbWqhai7H7HqgK8iLStjkl8bzWCiAYcJdry3fHrdoMZzUAEB3f6u4QwSeA1gRFjO9jcdFo6J1Tb35tG/OJn684HmCWV3kzCQZj4kgvb+ZC7g+LjUFQJjV814MDpEIdtB2rxP74cdTNEpY4SE51mSsaCpNgZF/gBFLnInD5CnJ+AUJc3TGrzLZsqmBdLgC1X/zY3yUTTQjYLLcf9YSKJCQsvFm5oZA5YXGU3xQ84d5WTW9cF4WdloqHBEBm3wslz78qR/oNXX3Ip9AZzLjKuIH7KKZ09r6GBM42KGCSvQ6bSmCAPs6XYHO+BMkKIgtE0VvItV1DU4VkXVNp4tkZ8mEKCI2XYXRfEJndQZz478vHsFIHIvyAdJktXTqB4PRLwoxueYYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":818,"cache_read_input_tokens":46962,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":818,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTXCFEuvZXqGGmX57en2z","type":"assistant","uuid":"41bde402-f5e4-4a3e-a01c-ec6c841f72c5","timestamp":"2025-09-26T14:47:16.385Z"}
