## 🏗️ Architecture

### Session-Based Design
Commands create session directories in your current project:
```
your-project/
├── implement/          # Implementation sessions
│   ├── plan.md        # Execution plan and progress
│   └── state.json     # Session state for resuming
├── scaffold/          # Scaffolding sessions
├── refactor/          # Refactoring sessions
└── ...
```

### Configuration Structure
```
~/.claude/
├── commands/          # 26 command definitions (.md files)
├── projects/          # Session logs per project (.jsonl)
├── todos/             # Todo tracking with unique session IDs
├── settings.json      # Main CLI configuration
├── statusline.sh      # Git-aware custom status line
└── CLAUDE.md          # Project guidance and conventions
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Git repository (recommended)
- Node.js/npm (for status line features)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this configuration to your `~/.claude` directory
2. The configuration will be automatically recognized by Claude Code
3. Custom status line will activate automatically with git-aware features

### Custom Status Line
The included `statusline.sh` provides:
- Current git branch display
- Lines added/removed statistics
- Working tree status indicators
- Claude model information

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start a development session
/session-start "Adding user authentication"

# Implement a feature from description or URL
/implement "Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens"

# Run tests and fix any issues
/test

# Review and commit changes
/review
/commit "Add JWT authentication system"

# End session with summary
/session-end
```

### Advanced Workflows
```bash
# Full feature development cycle
/scaffold component UserProfile
/implement /path/to/design.md
/test
/security-scan
/docs
/commit "Add user profile management"

# Code quality improvement
/understand
/fix-todos
/fix-imports
/format
/review
```

## 🔧 Core Principles

### Session Continuity
- All commands support automatic resume from interruptions
- Session state preserved across Claude Code instances
- Progress tracking through structured todo lists and state files

### Pattern Recognition
- Automatically adapts to existing code conventions
- Follows project-specific patterns and standards
- Maintains consistency across all modifications

### Quality Assurance
- Built-in validation after every change
- Automatic testing with failure analysis and fixes
- Security scanning with remediation tracking
- Rollback capabilities when validation fails

### Git Integration
- Clean commit messages following project conventions
- No AI attribution in commits
- Automatic staging of relevant files
- Never modifies git configuration or user credentials

## 📊 Command Execution Phases

All commands follow a structured 5-phase approach:

1. **Analysis** - Deep pattern recognition and project understanding
2. **Planning** - Detailed execution plan with validation steps
3. **Implementation** - Systematic code changes with progress tracking
4. **Validation** - Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
5. **Completion** - Session summary and state cleanup

## 🔍 Session Management

### Project Isolation
- Sessions are project-specific and isolated
- Multiple simultaneous sessions supported across different projects
- Session state includes full context for seamless resume
- Automatic cleanup of completed sessions

### Integration Points
- Statsig analytics for feature flag management
- Todo system with unique session IDs for progress tracking
- Shell integration via custom status line
- Project memory through CLAUDE.md generation

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

### Security Features
- Comprehensive security scanning with `/security-scan`
- Credential detection and protection
- Best practice enforcement
- Vulnerability remediation guidance

### Development Guidelines
- Never create files unless absolutely necessary
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Session files created in current project directory only
- No documentation files created unless explicitly requested
